#### Final thoughts
This project was a fantastic opportunity to work on my first game creation. I ran into multiple challenges while trying to come up with an idea. Initially, I was planning to create a one-piece map, but I needed a different approach. Then I decided to make a fast-paced pong game, but the code was problematic, and the game was too fast for players to enjoy. So, I eventually decided to make a pong game with the World Cup as the theme. I ended up enjoying the process and learned a lot along the way. It was also great to show my siblings this game because I am the creator, and it feels fantastic to finally have it completed.
